Blue Dungeon - Demo
Made by Marci & Bence @ Codecool - WIP - Do not share!
Blue Dungeon is a dungeon crawler style game, where you have to pick up weapons, kill monsters and advance.
Tutorial:
There is currently one level with monsters and items.
The player is the blue guy, fighting anything in its way.
Arrow keys - movement
Space - pick up item
R - respawn (if dead)
S - save to SQL, local database required
C - select save from SQL
L - load the selected save file (always use C first)
How to play:
Use the arrow keys to move.
When standing on the same tile as an item, press space to pick it up.
To fight monsters, stand in their way and push them.
Monsters only punch back when you attack.
Collect the key to unlock the door to the next level. (WIP)
Monsters:
Skeleton - the weakest enemy, moves randomly through the map
Guard - moves horizontally in a corridor
Orc - moves vertically
Golem - does not move, but it is tough
Brute - the red headed guy, the strongest enemy on the map
Axolotl - passive mobs, they can swim but they don't attack
Items:
Shield - gives you 1 extra armor point
Sword - gives you 1 extra damage point
Potion - gives you 10 HP
Key - unlocks the door (currently no use)
